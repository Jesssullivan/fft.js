# FFT.js
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/fft.js.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/fft.js)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/fft.js.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/fft.js)

Implementation of Radix-4 FFT.

## Usage

```js
const FFT = require('fft.js');

const f = new FFT(4096);

const input = new Array(4096);
input.fill(0);

const data = f.toComplexArray(input);
const out = f.createComplexArray();

f.transform(out, data);
console.log(out);
console.log(f.fromComplexArray(out));

// For inverse - use:
f.inverseTransform(data, out);
```
