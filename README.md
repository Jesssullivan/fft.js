# FFT.js

Implementation of Radix-4 (and Radix-2) FFT.

## Usage

```js
const FFT = require('fft.js');

const f = new FFT(4096);

const input = new Array(4096);
input.fill(0);

const data = f.toComplexArray(input);
f.transform(data);
const output = f.fromComplexArray(data);

// For inverse - use:
f.inverseTransform(data);
```
